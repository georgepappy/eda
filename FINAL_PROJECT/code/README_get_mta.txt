The python executable get_mta.py was provided by Metis to make retrieving the desired date range(s) of MTA Turnstile data relatively simple.

In accordance with the instructions provided in get_mta.md, I used the following command (from a console command line) to retrieve my data and store it in an SQLite database for use in this project:

python get_mta.py "(1904|1905|1906|1907|2104|2105|2106|2107)"
